    <h4>What is a cryptocurrency?</h4>
    <p>     A Crypto currency, like Bitcoin, is a virtual currency that is not controlled by a central goverment or body. Instead is has many "nodes" which keeps the ledger, or transaction record, correct and up to date. The "miners" do this by utilzing specialized computeres to solve math problems, or hashs, that make sure the currency is not being forged. For more information take a look at this quick youtube video explaining the basics of Bitcoin.</p>

    <h4>Why invest in cryptocurrencys?</h4>
    <p>     Crypto currencies is considered one of the fastest growing markets out there right now. The new technology allows the market to grow expodentially and therfore have higher returns then the regular stock market would. However, this does mean that more risk is inherently associated with it. Most coins prices are build on speculation and therfore will ride with how people are feeling about the coins. In some cases the coins value is directly effected by its use in retail purchases. For example we saw a pretty big spike up to $17,000 in early December of 2017 after news was relased that Bitcoin would be traded on a new exchange. </p>
